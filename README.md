# Pathfinder Stuff
Player Accessible Documents for my Pathfinder Campaigns

Listen, I'm a developer. Even worse, I'm an Emacs enthusiast. When I write documentation,
I want Markdown or `org-mode`, and I want a place to host and beautify the documentation
I share with my players. Especially the beautify part. Non-developers should not be exposed
to the horrors of Emacs.
